QN: Write a program to print twin primes less than 1000. If two consecutive odd numbers are both prime then they are known as twin primes

def prime(x,y):
    div1=[x for x in range(2,x)]
    div2 = [x for x in range(2,y)]
    for i in div1:
        if x%i !=0:
            for j in div2:
                if y%j !=0:
                    print('{} and {} are twin prime'.format(x,y))
                    break
                else:
                    print('not a twin prime')
                    break
            break
