Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, 
the first 10 terms will be:1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


def fib(n, computed = {0:0, 1:1}):
    if n not in computed:
        computed[n] = fib(n-1, computed) + fib(n-2, computed)
    return computed[n]

count = 0
for i in range(1,1000):
    val = fib(i)
    if (val < 4000000) & (val % 2 == 0):
        count += val
print(count)
