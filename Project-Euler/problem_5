2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

def smallest_positive(num):
    
    divisible = []
    stats = False
    for i in range(1,21):
        if num%i == 0:
            stats = True
            continue
        
        else:
            stats = False
            break
        
    if stats == True:
        divisible.append(num)
        print('appended', num)
        
    return divisible
#         print('yes')
