QN: A number is called perfect if the sum of proper divisors of that number is equal to the
number. For example 28 is perfect number, since 1+2+4+7+14=28. Write a program to
print all the perfect numbers in a given range


def printnumber(num):
    nums = []
    for i in range(1, num):
        if num%i == 0:
            nums.append(i)
    return nums
    
x = [24,28,26,20,21,22]
for j in x:
    print(printnumber(j))
